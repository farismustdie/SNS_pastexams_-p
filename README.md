This is a repository for SNS students to refer to when looking for Old past papers. 
The files are organized in the following branches:
Discipline -> Course -> MSE/ESE -> FileName

FileName must be set in one standard for ease of use and should be in the following manner:
<CourseName>_<Instrctor>_<Year>.pdf

Others can add their files by becoming a collaborator. Simply contact me and I'll add you in as a collaborator.
